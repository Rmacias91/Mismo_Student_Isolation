## An Android Application that helps solve student Isolation.

### Purpose of the App
This project was made for a class I took over the summer at Georgia Tech, Educational Technology. We were given the option of doing
research or a project. Of course I decided on an android application, but I wound up doing more research. Since this class was fairly short
over the summer, the application is pretty basic. I tried my best to focus on what solutions would help students who were not making friends
in school. It's a relevant problem in today's society.

### Note
This is made for api > 23
Not certain how it will perform on lower apis. Since my family and friends run somewhat up to date phones, no one needed a lower api.
If there are crashes, let me know and I'll update it to work with lower apis.

### To Install 
Go to my app/release/app-release.apk Or [Click here](https://github.com/Rmacias91/Mismo_Student_Isolation/tree/master/app/release/app-release.apk)
Download and install on your phone. :) I'll start publishing my apps on the store soon!

The Application has two ideas I thought would help students make friends, based on my research. The application lets users make
and join events. 
1. Here is the Event Page

The second functionality of the application was to have a list of content that the students can learn from. The content provided
are videos and articles that teach social skills. There is also content that uses cogntivite therapy. I used Youtube SDK to
present the videos.

Example of the Article Page.

### What tools did I use to make this?
I decided it was time to learn Kotlin, firebase, and some of the new architecture components introduced by google. I did not get to fully implement the architecture tools due to a time limitation, but I was close! Kotlin is amazing, and I'm really glad I forced
myself to try it out, even with the short deadline. Firebase is amazing to do a quick prototype. My last project I had to half of my development
time working on the node and aws programs. Now with firebase, it was all about the application :) I'm starting to see great progress in my applications. :D
